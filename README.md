# ECON5200-Applied-Data-Analytics-in-Econ
# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository documents my academic and applied work for **ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**.  
It reflects my journey in integrating **economic reasoning**, **causal inference**, and **modern data science tools** to analyze real-world economic problems.

## 👤 About Me

I am an **undergraduate economics student** aspiring to pursue roles in **Data Analysis** and **Tech Economics**.  
My academic focus lies in translating **traditional economic theory** into **data-driven insights**, using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques.

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate my ability to:
- Think critically about economic mechanisms  
- Apply rigorous empirical methods  
- Scale classical econometric ideas using modern computational tools

## 📂 About This Portfolio

This repository hosts my **coursework, labs, and applied projects** for ECON 5200.

### Course Philosophy: Concept Extension
The course follows a *Concept Extension* approach:
- We begin with **foundational statistical and econometric concepts** (e.g., OLS regression, bias–variance tradeoff)
- Then extend them using **machine learning algorithms** (e.g., Lasso, cross-validation, regularization)

Through this process, I am learning how to:
- Combine **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**
- Understand the tradeoffs between interpretability and performance
- Apply economic intuition when evaluating data-driven models
