## 👋 About This Portfolio

Welcome! I'm an undergraduate economics student building expertise at the intersection of causal inference and predictive analytics. This repository showcases my coursework from **ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**, where I'm learning to scale foundational statistical methods using machine learning techniques.

### The Approach

This course follows a *Concept Extension* philosophy: we start with core econometric tools—like ordinary least squares regression—and extend them into the machine learning domain with algorithms like Lasso and Ridge regression. The goal is to understand not just *how* to use these tools, but *when* and *why* each approach is appropriate for different economic questions.

I'm particularly interested in:
- Applying predictive models to economic forecasting problems
- Using causal inference methods to evaluate policy impacts
- Translating complex quantitative findings into actionable insights
